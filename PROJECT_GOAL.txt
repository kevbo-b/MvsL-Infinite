When is it DONE?


first Rule: keep it simple!


* = side ideas

-Simple Menu: misc Configurations, Game Options, Level Choosing. Option for Mode: Network or local


* same star spawn order every time (option)


-Game itself:

-begins with ready screen (indicate where each player plays on screen)
-starting out of pipe
-star is spawning
-changes in stats shown in HUD
-when player lost all lives / all stars are collected, game ends. Return to screen of choosing level


-needs more levels

* blue shell item
* more than 4 players
