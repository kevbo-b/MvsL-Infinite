---------------------------------------------

 THIS IS OUTDATED!!! Changes are now on Git.

---------------------------------------------

20 Nov 19

+Fixed Red Koopa Spazziness by keeping the RayCast enabled (Also set an condition for infinite world change)
+Red Koopa: added second Ray cast for almost-off-the-edge Situations
+Area2D Refresh: wrote a Function to reset an Areas Specific mask bits
+Fixed problem in Enemies, where player wouldnt be damaged after "Invincible To Player" Timer is over with a Area2D Refresh (for all shell types) 
+Added Resizable Firebar
+Added Spike

*Spike detection is bad. Player should possibly look for fixed spikes himself
*Firebar AND Spike doesnt kill player after hes invincible and stays in area (consider Area_entered in player)
*Mega Shroom grow goes more smoothly. Only Needs Animation, Room detection + Stop Music when dead
*Player sometimes invincible to Buzzy Beetle, reason unknown. Consider using area_entered



21 Nov 19

+Added Transition to death / respawn of player (vs mode and other modes)
+Firebar can spin Counter-Clockwise

*Added a Coop/Solo Menu. No Function to start coop game yet (start like in smb with lives), changed Background and some other stuff


22 Nov 19

+Spike can be triggered, moved up and down (standard move spike down a bit (16px)!)

23 Nov 19

++Fixed Area Detection of Player after Receiving Damage (invincibleTimer and Star)
+Therefore fixed some conditions like invincible player jumping

+Spike can now move and gives damage, triggers and works flawlessly
+fixed Jumping off as Idle (not possible, changes to jump anim.)
+fixed falling with same anim (changes to frozen run)
+Added NSMB Underground Level

*Reprogrammed tileset, has now 60+ slots for interactive blocks (Spike inserted)
, some blocks are off now (Question Block, Bush...)

LO:
Collect coins where hit on top of block, fucked this up. Coin Animation totally asyncron across other coins.
Also: Koopa Red does what he wants after respawn. He doesnt notice ledges anymore


24 Nov 19

+Coin gets collected on top of Block like in NSMB. Even generator spawned Enemies execute the function, through pow etc.


Error: ' !area_in && !E ' is true because of POWs. Happens even when only a single POW explodes and hits not an other one
SOLUTION: something to do with $BlastRadius in despawn() in PowBlock.gd. If commented both commands, error is gone!
*KoopaRed walk off fail still persists


26 Nov 19

+Fixed !area_in && !E Error in  POW Blocks.
+KoopaRed walk off fixed
+Fixed the Tileset, All Item Blocks are now avaiable and the Palette switches just fine!
+Added Shader to coin, coin now fits to environment.

*Player sometimes still is invinicble to enemies / can't interact with them

LO: Set some Menu fades (Pause Quit, Start Level), doesnt look tooo smooth yet?


27 Nov 19

+fixed existing Levels and Level selection
+added new invisible Block (From Hard Relay Mario)
+added Ready Screen
+added Random Backgrounds
+fixed Generator to have a actual List

LO: added SnowLevel NSMB (undone), now fix the HUD that you now the control node structure!


28 Nov 19

+made restore of blocks better (ONLY despawned / hit Blocks)
+added IceBlock (breakable / unbreakable)
+added slippery effect (slippery raycast on player, slippery layer)
+Star Spawn sound doesnt happen on begin of match
+Replaced some sounds with original NSMB sounds
+added Star direction Arrow


*found weird bug: player is sometimes not fully on top of something (walking). Position is always off by a bit. Doesnt seem to affect gameplay.
Even  rounding position doesnt help

LO: Angle of Star Direction Arrow doesnt work out


29 Nov 19

+Fixed Star arrow, is working now
+Changed Item Spawning height
+max_coins changes with player amount (less coins needed with more players)
+MegaShroom now doesnt go through floor (only when crouched), MegaDestructiveFall changed, Area2Ds when DestructiveFall changed
+Added Winner Menu (When all Wins achieved), with some Stats
+Player 3 and 4 now controllable on its own
+Objects dont despawn above the screen
+mini shot dead star loose fix
+adjusted mega and star time
+adjusted arrow so it only shows at star spawn
+HUD shader when almost game done (one star left to collect)
+Added Music Player


*Stats in Winner Menu dont work 100% (stars)
*stats dont yet show in win screen
*Arrow doesnt care about the screen jump in calculation
*Arrow is active on dead, should be on after spawn if star spawned or something
*Music doesnt interrupt on Game Overs
*Music doesnt stay hectic when repeating loop at max - 1 stars
*Shader of HUD stars doesnt look so good

LO: Create Levels: Break box with alot of POWs, activated by generator (POW which doesnt hurt players or something)

Platform Chaos level


30 Nov 19

+added new Level (Castle Style) > Custom_CastleLike1
+added Mini passes to Tileset
+Music now properly plays hectic, stops on Game Overs
+Firebar Block is now a alwaysHit Question Block, therefore breakable
+Changed Collision of Mini Mushroom
+Changed Spawn Rate of Items, has yet to be star count dependent

*When big, invisible blocks still stop yout jumping
*After Mega, can stay in firebar (no refresh)


1 Dec 19

+Fixed Fast Music Playback (Hectic Theme)
+Player / Enemies / Star move out of wall when stuck. Downwarp only with items (rough)

LO: mini and mega still stuck in wall. Get outside wall for items/star is unfluid and looks bad
Also: look phone m9


5 Dec 19

+Enemies Now Respawn when walked in with players screen (No spawn-death on player anymore) aka Respawn ONLY offscreen

*Goomba did some respawning BS, died or spawned bad. fixed with motion not calculating when despawned.

+Fixed with Motion calc disabling at despawn.

+Bump SFX now has fixed SFXChannel, Plays only if Enemy is on Screen (With function in Enemy Base Class playEnemySFX())
+Item Appear from Block now has fixed SFXChannel

@ Learned, that call_deferred doesnt directly add a child to a node, but takes one more machine cycle to do so?
use call_defered only if necessary!

! no BUMP sound from enemy when hitting interactible Blocks (no sound ONLY when hitting switch Block?)


10 Dec 19
